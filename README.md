## Introduction

This document outlines a strategic plan to grow an open source community.

## Plan
* [Build an affiliates and ambassadors program](#affiliates-and-ambassadors),
* [Further expand the community internationally](#international-expansion),
* [Promote "satellite" events and activities](#satellite-events).

## Affiliates and Ambassadors
* Deploy a CRM if none already exists (this gives the team visibility on who is reaching who and measure progress),
* Identify the target audience and start populating potential contacts,
* Develop a value proposition for each audience,
* Design onboarding experience for each audience and types of contributions/engagement desired,
* Reach out to these potential affiliates,
* Ask for referrals of individuals who would be interested in joining (both staff and community members),
* Organizations get invited to become affiliates, and individuals get invited to become ambassadors.
* As the number of affiliates and ambassadors grow, create dedicated pages on the website to formally recognize each,
* Provide channels for cross-project discussion and collaboration.
* Create a strategy for each marketing/contribution channel (Blog, Newsletter, Podcast, Social Media, Code Repository, etc). For example, for the Blog, invite affiliates and ambassadors for guest posts. Also publish guest posts for them. This is a great way to reach a new audience to expand our network and also to let them tap into ours.
* As the community matures, publish resources in different formats, languages, and tailored for different audiences. Examples: Specification, Documentation, One pagers, Infographics, Checklists, White papers, Scientific Papers and Articles, eBooks, Case studies, Reference Training Programs, User Manuals, Developer Manuals, Handbooks, Reports, etc.
* Allow affiliates and ambassadors to add satellite events and activities to the website (see the Events section below).

## International Expansion
* Constantly assess the global distribution of the community (through website geolocation data, mailing list email addresses, social media profiles, surveys, etc), always respecting privacy.
* Make a conscious effort to expand the community internationally by reaching out to new contacts.
* Create incentives for the publication of content in languages other than English.
* Content in a new language attracts a more diverse set of individuals and organizations to the project, who in return contribute back to the project making it even better.
* Ideally the software should also be multilingual. Provide users the option to select a language and locale.
* Work with Affiliates and Ambassadors to organize events worldwide and produce local content (see the Events section below).

## Satellite Events

* Grow the main conference while promoting “satellite” events and activities worldwide.
* With the assistance from Affiliates and Ambassadors, promote these satellite events and activities.
* Allow affiliates and ambassadors to add satellite events and activities to the website.
* Provide guidelines to local organizers on how to produce a successful event, including: finding a venue, setting a date, seeking sponsors, managing budget and timeline, selecting speakers, marketing the event, handling catering and audio/video equipment, etc.
* Make sure these events have a code of conduct and promote diversity and inclusion.
